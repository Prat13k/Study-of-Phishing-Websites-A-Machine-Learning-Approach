<h1><p align = "center"> Study of Phishing Websites: A Machine Learning Approach. </p></h1>

<p align = "justify" >This project is focused on detecting phishing websites through the application of machine learning techniques. Phishing, a prevalent cybersecurity threat, involves malicious websites designed to mimic legitimate ones to steal sensitive user information. To combat this, the project employs various machine learning models that analyze multiple features of websites and classify them as either phishing or legitimate. The objective is to create a reliable, data-driven system that can automatically assess a website's credibility based on its structural and content characteristics.</p>

<p align = "justify">The model is trained on a dataset containing attributes commonly associated with phishing sites, such as URL length, use of HTTPS, presence of suspicious keywords, and more. Using classification algorithms, including decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines, the model evaluates the features and provides an accuracy score, highlighting the most effective techniques for phishing detection. This project aims to contribute to cybersecurity by automating the identification of phishing threats, which can be further enhanced into a full MLOps pipeline or deployed as an application to alert users in real-time about potential risks associated with visiting suspicious websites.</p>
