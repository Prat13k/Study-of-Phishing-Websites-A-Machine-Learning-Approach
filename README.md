# Study of phishing websites : A machine learning appraoch

#### Problem Statement
<p align = "justify">In this repository you will find about the project "Study of phishing website a Machine Learning Approach" in which the detection and classification of phishing websites were performed by using several machine learning and deep learning approaches.</p>

#### Solution
<p align = "justify">In this project we used and applied several machine learning and deep learning algorithms to determine whether the websitrs are phihsing website or not. The data of those websites was gathered from kaggle.com. After applying several machine learning and deep learning algorithms. We determined the best results that which one of the algorithm provides best result for the detectiion of the phishing websites.</p>

#### About Data
<p align = "justify">Data Collection: In this project we first collected a dataset of phishing and legitimate websites from various sources. The dataset was then pre-processed to extract relevant features from the website pages.</p>

<p align = "justify">Feature Extraction: The project extracted several features from the website pages, including the website URL, domain age, SSL certificate, webpage content, and more.</p>

<p align = "justify">Model Selection: The project experimented with several machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, to identify the best-performing model.</p>

<p align = "justify">Model Evaluation: The performance of the machine learning models was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results showed that the Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy of 100%.</p>

#### Result 
<p align = "justify">It was recorded that several machine learning and deep learning algorithms have given high and similar precision and accuracy. The best result which we achieved was about 100% accuracy. The Machine Learning technique like Random Forest and Decision Tree gave us the accuracy of 1.000 as well as the same result was achieved by XGBoost, Autoencoder and SVM. Meanwhile the Multilayer Perceptron achieved the Accuracy of 0.968.</p>

<p align = "justify">Overall, the project successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in detecting and classifying phishing websites with high accuracy. The results achieved in this project have the potential to aid in the development of better anti-phishing tools and technologies.</p>
