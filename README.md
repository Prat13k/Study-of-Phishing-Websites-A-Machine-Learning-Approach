# Study of phishing websites a machine learning appraoch

#### Problem Statement
In this repository you will be finding out about the project Study of phishing website a Machine Learning Approach in which discussed about the Detection and classification of phishing website were performed by using several machine learning and deep learning approaches.

#### Solution
In this project we used and applied several machine learning and deep learning algorithm to determine whetehr the website is a phihsing website or not. The data of those webistes was gathered from kaggle.com. After applying several machine learning and deep learning algorithms. We determined the best results that which one of the algorithm provides best result for the detectiion of the phishing websites.

#### Result 
It was recorded that several machine learning and deep learning algorithms have given high and similar precision and accuracy.
